## 💬 Personalized Icebreaker

> Hi,
>
> I noticed Fairfax Launderette has been a community staple since the 1960s—impressive to see you offering everything from quick self-service washes to specialist wedding dress cleaning, all under one roof.
>
> Looking at your hours, I see you're open 8am-8pm daily but your attendant service runs until 1pm. That's 7 hours where customers popping in after work might have questions about your duvet cleaning prices (£13-20 depending on size, I noticed) or want to arrange a collection—but can't easily get answers.
>
> We recently helped a similar launderette add a simple QR code chatbot that customers scan while waiting. It handles questions about wash cycles, pricing for specialist items, and even lets customers book collections. The owner said it's like having an extra staff member who never takes a break.
>
> Would you be open to a quick 10-minute chat to see if something like this could work for Fairfax Launderette?
>
> Best regards
