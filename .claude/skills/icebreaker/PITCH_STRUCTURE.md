# Pitch Structure Framework

This document defines how to craft compelling, personalized icebreaker messages for AI chatbot sales outreach.

## The HRPSC Framework

Every effective icebreaker follows this structure:

### H - Hook (1 sentence MAX)

Start DIRECTLY with the observation. Never use filler phrases.

**RED FLAG OPENERS (Never use):**
- "I came across your business while researching..."
- "I was looking at local businesses and found..."
- "I noticed your website and wanted to reach out..."
- "I hope this email finds you well..."

**GOOD (Direct observation):**
- "Fairfax Launderette is open until 8pm, but your attendant finishes at 1pm."
- "I see you offer free collection within 5 miles—great value for busy families."
- "Your Google reviews mention your friendly staff—but they can only help until 1pm."

**KEY RULE:** If you can delete the first sentence and lose nothing, delete it.

---

### Local Angle (Optional Power-Up)

If your company is in the same area as the target business, USE IT. Local = trust.

**How to check:** Compare target's location to your company location in CLAUDE.md.

**If same town/area, add to Hook:**
- "I'm based in Westcliff too—noticed Fairfax just down the road."
- "As a fellow Westcliff business..."
- "We're local to the area, so I know how busy Fairmead Avenue gets."

**Why it works:**
- Signals you're not a mass-email sender from overseas
- Creates instant rapport ("we're neighbors")
- Makes follow-up easier ("I could pop in")

**If NOT local:**
- Don't fake it
- Skip the local angle entirely
- Focus on other personalization (industry expertise, specific research)

---

### R - Research Proof (1 sentence)
Show specific insight that proves genuine research.

**Good:** "I see you're open 8am-8pm but your attendant service runs until 1pm—that's 7 hours of self-service only."

**Bad:** "I noticed you have long opening hours."

---

### P - Pain Point (1 sentence, AS A QUESTION)

Frame the problem as a question, not an accusation. This invites dialogue instead of defensiveness.

**BAD (Accusatory):**
- "That's 7 hours where customers can't get answers."
- "You're probably losing bookings."
- "Customers are walking away without help."

**GOOD (Curious question):**
- "How are you handling questions during those unstaffed hours?"
- "Do customers ever get stuck with machine settings or pricing when no one's around?"
- "Do you ever miss enquiries from people who call after 1pm?"

**WHY:** Questions feel collaborative. Statements feel like an audit.

---

### S - Solution (1-2 sentences, OUTCOME-FOCUSED)

Lead with the outcome, not the feature.

**BAD (Feature-focused):**
- "Our chatbot answers questions about wash cycles and takes bookings."
- "We offer an AI chatbot with 24/7 availability."
- "Our solution integrates with your website and handles FAQs."

**GOOD (Outcome-focused):**
- "A similar launderette stopped missing afternoon enquiries by adding a QR code assistant."
- "The owner said it's like having extra help during unstaffed hours—without the wage bill."
- "One launderette captured 23 wedding dress leads they would have missed."

---

### C - Call to Action (Micro-CTA)

Shorter = less friction. Offer an easy yes/no.

**Micro-CTAs (Preferred):**
- "Worth a quick chat?"
- "Worth exploring?"
- "Want me to send a 30-second demo?"
- "Happy to pop by if easier."

**Medium CTAs:**
- "Open to a 10-minute call this week?"

**AVOID:**
- "Would you be open to scheduling a quick 10-minute chat to see if this could work for Fairfax Launderette?"
- "Let me know when you're free and I'll send a calendar invite."
- "Can we find 15 minutes to discuss this in more detail?"

---

## Subject Line Guidelines

Every pitch needs 2-3 subject line options. Subject lines determine open rates.

**Effective patterns:**
1. **Problem-focused:** "Question about the 1pm-8pm gap"
2. **Curiosity:** "Handling customer questions after hours?"
3. **Specific + Short:** "Fairfax unstaffed hours"

**Rules:**
- Under 50 characters
- Reference their business or specific problem
- Never mention "chatbot" or "AI" in subject line
- No clickbait or ALL CAPS

**Examples for launderette:**
- "Quick question about afternoon coverage"
- "Fairfax + unstaffed hours"
- "Do customers ask questions after 1pm?"

---

## Personalization Requirements

### Finding the Owner/Contact Name

**ALWAYS try to find a name.** "Hi there" signals mass email.

**Where to look:**
1. About Us page (often mentions owner by name)
2. Contact page (may list key staff)
3. Google reviews (owner often responds with name)
4. LinkedIn (search "[Business Name] owner")
5. Companies House (UK businesses)

**If no name found:**
- Use: "Hi," (just "Hi" with comma)
- Or: "Hi [Business Name] team,"
- Never: "Hi there," or "To whom it may concern"

### Other Personalization Requirements

Every pitch MUST include at least 3 specific details from the research:

1. **Business identifier**: Name, location, or unique characteristic
2. **Service reference**: Specific service they offer with price if found
3. **Operational insight**: Hours, staffing model, or process observation

---

## Tone Guidelines

### DO
- Sound like a helpful human, not a sales script
- Use their business name naturally (1-2 times, not more)
- Reference specific services/prices you found
- Keep it conversational and warm
- Show genuine interest in their business

### DON'T
- Use excessive exclamation marks
- Make promises you can't keep
- Use pushy sales language ("limited time", "act now")
- Be generic or templated-sounding
- Overwhelm with features

---

## Length Guidelines

**Ideal length:** 100-150 words (MAX)

- Short enough to read in 20 seconds on a phone
- Long enough to prove genuine research (2-3 specific details)
- Every sentence must earn its place—if it doesn't add value, cut it

---

## Success Story Integration

When including success stories:

1. **Match the context**: Similar industry, similar size, similar challenge
2. **Be specific**: Include a concrete detail or outcome
3. **Keep it brief**: One sentence, not a case study
4. **Make it relatable**: "A similar [business type]" works well
5. **Focus on outcomes**: Not features

**Example patterns:**
- "A similar [industry] stopped missing [specific enquiry type]..."
- "One [business type] owner said it's like [benefit]—without [cost/effort]."
- "In the first month, they captured [number] leads they would have otherwise missed."

---

## Industry-Specific Language

Load terminology from the relevant industry file. Examples:

**Laundry:**
- "self-service machines" not "washing machines"
- "service washes" not "laundry services"
- "collection and delivery" not "pickup service"

**Real Estate:**
- "viewings" not "showings" (UK)
- "property inquiries" not "home questions"
- "vendor" not "seller" (UK)

---

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing the pitch, verify:

- [ ] **Under 150 words** (ideally 100-120)
- [ ] **No filler opening** (doesn't start with "I came across...")
- [ ] **Owner name used** (or explained why not found)
- [ ] **Pain point is a question** (not accusatory statement)
- [ ] **Solution focuses on outcome** (not features)
- [ ] **Micro-CTA** (under 10 words)
- [ ] **2-3 subject line options** included
- [ ] **Key statistic bolded** (in the message, if applicable)
- [ ] Business name appears 1-2 times (not more)
- [ ] Reads naturally when spoken aloud

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### The Generic Opener
"I help businesses like yours improve customer service with AI."

### The Feature Dump
"Our chatbot offers 24/7 support, multilingual capabilities, CRM integration, analytics dashboard..."

### The Assumptive Close
"I've scheduled us for a call on Thursday at 2pm."

### The Guilt Trip
"You're probably losing customers every day without a chatbot."

### The Competitor Bash
"Unlike other chatbot solutions that don't work..."

### The Long-Winded CTA
"Would you be open to scheduling a quick 10-minute chat to see if this could work for your business?"

## Multi-Touch Outreach Strategy

First messages should be **link-free** to avoid spam filters. Build the sequence across touches:

### Touch 1: The Icebreaker (This Skill)
- Lead with a compelling stat or observation
- No links in first message
- Goal: Get a response

**Example stat hook:**
> "One of our clients, a laundromat called DoBrasil, captured 49% of their enquiries outside business hours—52 conversations in 6 weeks they would have missed."

### Touch 2: The Value Add (Follow-up)
- Share relevant blog post or case study
- Now safe to include link
- Reference their initial response (if any)

**Example:**
> "Wrote up the DoBrasil case study if you're curious how they handle after-hours questions: [link]"

### Touch 3: The Demo Offer (Final Touch)
- Offer low-friction demo
- Specific to their business type

**Example:**
> "Built a quick demo for launderettes—shows how the QR code flow works. Want me to send it?"

### Why This Works
- **No links in Touch 1** = bypasses spam filters
- **Stat-first approach** = creates curiosity without selling
- **Gradual escalation** = builds trust before asking for time
