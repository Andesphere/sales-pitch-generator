# Laundry & Dry Cleaning Industry Knowledge

This file contains domain expertise for generating pitches to launderettes, dry cleaners, and laundry service businesses.

## Industry Overview

**Business Types:**
- Self-service launderettes (coin-op or card-operated)
- Full-service laundry (drop-off wash & fold)
- Dry cleaners (specialist garment care)
- Combined laundry/dry cleaning operations
- Commercial laundry services (B2B)

**Typical Business Model:**
- Often family-owned, single or few locations
- Mix of self-service and attended service
- Long operating hours (often 12+ hours/day)
- Limited staffing during all open hours
- Regulars plus walk-in customers

---

## Common Pain Points

### 1. The "Hours Gap" Problem
**What it is:** Most launderettes are open much longer than they're staffed.

**Evidence to look for:**
- Opening hours vs. "attendant hours" or "staffed hours"
- Self-service advertised during certain hours
- "Last wash" times different from closing time

**Pitch angle (question-based):**
> "You're open 12 hours but staffed for 5—do customers ever need help during those unstaffed afternoon hours?"

### 2. Self-Service Customer Confusion
**What it is:** First-time users don't know how machines work, what settings to use, or pricing.

**Common questions:**
- How do I use the machines?
- Which cycle for [specific item]?
- How much does it cost?
- Do you take card/cash/app?
- How long will my wash take?

**Pitch angle (question-based):**
> "Do first-time customers ever get stuck choosing the right cycle or figuring out payment when no one's around to help?"

### 3. After-Hours Service Inquiries
**What it is:** Customers calling about specialist services when no one can answer.

**Common inquiries:**
- Duvet/bedding cleaning prices
- Wedding dress cleaning process
- Leather/suede care availability
- Collection and delivery areas
- Turnaround times

**Pitch angle (question-based):**
> "When someone Googles 'wedding dress cleaning near me' at 8pm and finds you—how do they get pricing or turnaround info before tomorrow?"

### 4. Collection & Delivery Booking Friction
**What it is:** No easy way to arrange pickup/delivery outside staffed hours.

**Evidence:**
- "Call to arrange collection"
- No online booking system
- Limited collection hours

**Pitch angle (question-based):**
> "For customers who want to book a collection outside your staffed hours—is there an easy way for them to do that?"

### 5. Pricing Complexity
**What it is:** Laundries often have complex pricing that's hard to communicate.

**Complexity factors:**
- Per-item vs. per-load pricing
- Different prices for different items (shirts, bedding, coats)
- Specialist items (wedding dresses, curtains, rugs)
- Express service premiums
- Collection/delivery fees

**Pitch angle (question-based):**
> "With so many services and price points, do customers ever call just to get a quick quote before deciding to visit?"

## Success Stories

**IMPORTANT:** Only use stories with verified data. Check `data/` folder for real client stats. Never fabricate or hallucinate statistics.

### Story 1: DoBrasil - The After-Hours Champion (VERIFIED)
> "One of our clients, a laundromat called DoBrasil, captured **49% of their enquiries outside business hours**—52 conversations in 6 weeks that would have gone unanswered."

**Data source:** `data/chatbot-j97439msq3r4a2xgrnnfbkjt417ws3yb-2026-01-16.json`

**Full verified stats:**
- 106 total conversations in 41 days
- 52 after-hours (49.1%): 17 evenings, 26 weekends, 9 early morning
- 12 leads captured (11.3% conversion rate)
- WhatsApp-based

**Use when:** Target has extended hours, after-hours gap, or limited staffing

**Phrasing options:**
- **Default:** "One of our clients, a laundromat called DoBrasil, captured..."
- **Shorter:** "A laundromat we work with captured 49% of enquiries after hours..."
- **Name-drop only:** "DoBrasil, one of our clients, handled 52 conversations outside business hours..."

---

### Generic Outcomes (No Specific Numbers)

Use these when DoBrasil isn't a good match for the prospect's situation. **NEVER invent specific numbers.**

> "Similar businesses report handling dozens of enquiries that would have gone to voicemail."

> "Owners tell us it's like having extra help during unstaffed hours—without the wage bill."

> "Customers get instant answers about pricing and hours instead of waiting until morning."

**Use when:** No verified data matches the prospect's situation closely

## Objection Handling

**"My customers aren't tech-savvy"**
> "Actually, the QR code approach works great—customers just point their phone camera, no app download needed. We've seen excellent adoption even with older customers who are comfortable with WhatsApp."

**"I'm there most of the time anyway"**
> "That's great for when you're there—but think about evenings, weekends, or when you pop out. The chatbot handles those gaps and collects contact info for you to follow up."

**"People prefer to just call"**
> "Absolutely, and they still can. The chatbot just catches the people who want a quick answer at 9pm, or who'd rather text than call. It's an extra channel, not a replacement."

## Red Flags & Opportunities

**Red Flags (approach carefully):**
- Very dated website (may lack budget)
- No prices listed anywhere (may be intentional)
- Franchise location (may need corporate approval)

**Green Light Opportunities:**
- Lists staffed hours separately from opening hours
- Offers collection service but "call to arrange"
- Has specialist services with no online pricing
- Good Google reviews mentioning helpful staff (they value service)
- Recently renovated or expanded (investing in business)
