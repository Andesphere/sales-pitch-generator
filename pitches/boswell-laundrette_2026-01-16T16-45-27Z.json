    "message": "Hi,\n\nI came across Boswell Laundrette while researching Central London laundry services—26 years in Holborn is impressive, and your reviews mention Tina by name, which says a lot about your service standards.\n\nQuick question: when someone searches \"wedding dress cleaning Holborn\" at 8pm and lands on your site, how do they get pricing or book a collection before you open the next morning?\n\nA laundromat we work with captured 49% of enquiries after hours—conversations that would have gone unanswered. Owners tell us it's like having extra help without the wage bill.\n\nWould a 10-minute chat be worth exploring whether something similar could work for Boswell?\n\nCheers,\nJorge",
