An AI chatbot on your site could do the same: answer pricing questions, explain your collection service, and capture contact details while you're closed.\n\nWould you be open to a quick chat about how this could work for Boswell?\n\nCheers,\nJorge",

Looking at your site, I noticed you offer collection and delivery across London, but customers need to call to arrange it.\n\nHere's an opportunity: people searching for 'laundry collection Bloomsbury' at 9pm are ready to book, but there's no way for them to do that until tomorrow. Some will book elsewhere.\n\nAn AI chatbot could take collection requests 24/7, answer pricing questions from your 50+ services, and hand you a list of warm leads each morning. Similar laundry businesses capture dozens of extra enquiries monthly this way.\n\nInterested in a quick conversation about how this might fit?\n\nCheers,\nJorge",

That last bit is key.\n\nBut you can't staff the phone at midnight when someone's researching wedding dress cleaning before their big day. A laundromat we work with, DoBrasil, solved this with an AI chatbot—52 after-hours conversations in 6 weeks, nearly half their total enquiries.\n\nThe chatbot answers like your helpful team would: explaining specialist services, quoting prices from your list, and capturing leads while you're closed.\n\nFancy a quick chat about bringing that 'helpful' reputation online 24/7?\n\nCheers,\nJorge",
