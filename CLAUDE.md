# Project Context

## Company Information

**Company:** Andesphere
**Product:** Andy (AI agent platform) — andypartner.com
**Founder:** Jorge Mena, Co-founder
**Location:** Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, UK

## Usage Notes for Icebreaker Skill

When generating icebreakers, check if the target business is in or near Westcliff-on-Sea (or broader Essex/South Essex area). If so, leverage the local angle for stronger personalization:

**Local areas to check for:**
- Westcliff-on-Sea
- Southend-on-Sea
- Leigh-on-Sea
- Thorpe Bay
- Shoeburyness
- Rochford
- Rayleigh
- Benfleet
- Canvey Island
- Hadleigh
- Basildon
- Grays
- Tilbury

**If local, add to the pitch:**
- Open with local angle: "I'm based in Westcliff too..." / "As a fellow South Essex business..."
- Include founder name + title mid-message (NOT as opening): "I'm Jorge, co-founder of Andy — we help local businesses..."
- End with: "Happy to pop by if easier."
- Sign off with just "Jorge" (first name only, keeps it personal)

**Why this works (research-backed):**
- Proximity psychology: "neighbor before business owner" activates trust
- Founder-to-owner: creates peer credibility (business owners trust other business owners)
- Combined effect: Local + Founder = strongest trust signal for SMB outreach

**If not local:**
- Skip the local angle entirely
- Don't fake proximity
- Focus on other personalization methods
