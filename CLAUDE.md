# Project Context

## Company Information

**Company:** Andesphere
**Location:** Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, UK

## Usage Notes for Icebreaker Skill

When generating icebreakers, check if the target business is in or near Westcliff-on-Sea (or broader Essex/South Essex area). If so, leverage the local angle for stronger personalization:

**Local areas to check for:**
- Westcliff-on-Sea
- Southend-on-Sea
- Leigh-on-Sea
- Thorpe Bay
- Shoeburyness
- Rochford
- Rayleigh
- Benfleet
- Canvey Island
- Hadleigh
- Basildon
- Grays
- Tilbury

**If local, add to the pitch:**
- "I'm based in Westcliff too..."
- "As a fellow South Essex business..."
- "We're local to the area..."
- End with "Happy to pop by if easier."

**If not local:**
- Skip the local angle entirely
- Don't fake proximity
- Focus on other personalization methods
